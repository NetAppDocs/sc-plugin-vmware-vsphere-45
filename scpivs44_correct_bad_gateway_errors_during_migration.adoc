There are several reasons why you might encounter a “Bad Gateway” error.

=== Scenario 1

You manually added files or other content to the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere and then tried to migrate. In this scenario, there is not enough space in the appliance for the migration process.

To correct this error, remove any manually added files.

=== Scenario 2

The SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere connection was stopped, or the service was stopped during the migration.

The SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere connection status must be “connected” during the migration process. You can also manually update the time out configuration in the virtual appliance.
