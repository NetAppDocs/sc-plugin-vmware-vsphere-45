If you want to use the new features provided by SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere, you must upgrade from NetApp Data Broker 1.0.x to SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.

.Before you begin

* The VM that you want to upgrade must have 12GB of RAM available.
* The VM that you want to upgrade must be powered on.
* A best practice is to back up the VM that contains NetApp Data Broker before the upgrade.

.About this task

There are three basic upgrade steps:

. Prepare for the upgrade.
. Download the upgrade .`iso` file.
. Install the upgrade.
.. Upload the .`iso` file to a datastore.
.. Connect the VM to the .`iso` file in the datastore.
.. Run the upgrade.

.Steps

. Prepare for the upgrade by disabling SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.
.. Log in to the NetApp Data Broker management GUI.
+
The IP is displayed when you deploy NetApp Data Broker.

.. Click Configuration in the left navigation pane, and then click the Service option in the *Plug-in Details* section to disable the plug-in.
. Download the upgrade .`iso` file.
.. Log in to the NetApp Support Site ( https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/index.html[https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/index.html^]).
.. From the list of products, select *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere*, then click the *DOWNLOAD LATEST RELEASE* button.
.. Download the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere upgrade .`iso` file to any location.
. Install the upgrade.
.. In your browser, navigate to the VMware vSphere vCenter.
.. On the vCenter GUI, click *vSphere Web Client (HTML5)*.
.. Log in to the *VMware vCenter Single Sign-On* page.
.. On the Navigator pane, click the NetApp Data Broker VM that you want to upgrade and then click the *Summary* tab.
..  On the *Related Objects* pane, click on any datastore in the list and then click the *Summary* tab.
.. On the *Files* tab for the selected datastore, click on any folder in the list, and then click the storage icon (*Upload a file to the Datastore*).
.. On the upgrade pop-up screen, navigate to the location where you downloaded the `.iso` file, then click on the `.iso` file image, and then click *Open*.
+
The file is uploaded to the datastore.

.. Navigate back to the NetApp Data Broker VM that you want to upgrade, and click the *Summary* tab.
+
In the *VM Hardware* pane, in the CD/DVD field, the value should be “Disconnected”.

.. Click the connection icon in the CD/DVD field and select *Connect to CD/DVD image on a datastore*.

+
.. In the wizard, do the following:
+
In the Datastores column, select the datastore where you uploaded the .`iso` file.
+
In the Contents column, navigate to the `.iso` file you uploaded, make sure “ISO image” is selected in the File Type field, and then click *OK*.
+
Wait until the field shows the “Connected” status.

.. Log onto the Maintenance console by accessing the *Summary* tab of the virtual appliance and then click the start icon to start the maintenance console.
.. Enter *2* for System Configuration, then enter *8* for Upgrade.
.. Enter *y* to continue and start the upgrade.

.After you finish

After the system displays the “upgrade successful” message, the system attempts to start the services.

. Wait until the “Press ENTER to continue” message displays, and then log into the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere management GUI.
+
The IP address is the same as the former NetApp Data Broker address.

. In the *Plug-in Details* section, enable the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere service and make sure the Status shows as “Connected”.

If you are using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere to support application-based data protection and the plug-in cannot communicate with the SnapCenter Server, refresh the connection to the SnapCenter Server: On the SnapCenter GUI, click *Hosts*, then select the VMware host, then click *Push Server Credentials*.
