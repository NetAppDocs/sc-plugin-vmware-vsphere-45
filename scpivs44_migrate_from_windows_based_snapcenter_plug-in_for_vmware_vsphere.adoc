If you are using the Windows-based SnapCenter VMware plug-in and want to use the features provided by the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere virtual appliance, you must deploy the virtual appliance and migrate your backup metadata.

.Before you begin

* Your backups of virtualized databases and filesystems must be integrated with SnapCenter.

* If the SnapCenter server is a VM, then it is a best practice to take a VMware-based snapshot before upgrading.
* Make sure the SnapCenter server is upgraded. See the link:scpivs44_release_notes.html[SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere Release Notes^] for information on supported upgrade paths.

.About this task

There are four basic steps:

. Download the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere `.ova` file.
. Suspend backup jobs for the Windows-based SnapCenter VMware plug-in.
. Deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere OVA.
. Migrate the Windows-based VMware backup metadata.

.Steps

. Download the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere `.ova` file.
.. Log in to the NetApp Support Site (https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/index.html[https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/index.html^]).
.. From the list of products, select *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere*, then click the *DOWNLOAD LATEST RELEASE* button.
.. Download the `.ova` file to any VM.
. Suspend backup jobs.
+
Make sure that no backup jobs are running in the Windows-based SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.
. Deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere OVA.
+
Because this is a new installation of the Linux-based SnapCenter VMware plug-in, follow the steps for deploying the OVA.
