You use the SnapCenter Windows PowerShell cmdlets to migrate SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere metadata from the Windows-based SnapCenter Server to the Linux-based SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere virtual appliance.

== Migration options
There are two migration options:

* Migrating from SnapCenter
+
You must migrate metadata for the following from Windows-based SnapCenter:

** VM-consistent backups performed by the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere when the plug-in was running as a Windows-based component of SnapCenter.
** Application-consistent data protection metadata of virtualized databases or file systems performed by a SnapCenter application-based plug-in with support from the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere when the plug-in was running as a Windows-based component of SnapCenter.
+
To migrate, you use the Windows SnapCenter PowerShell cmdlet `invoke-SCVOVAMigration.`
+
You can only migrate metadata from SnapCenter 4.0 or later.

* Migrating from VSC
+
You can migrate VSC 6.2.x (SMVI) metadata for backup jobs that are not integrated with SnapCenter.
+
To migrate, you use the NetApp ToolChest: NetApp Import Utility for SnapCenter and Virtual Storage Console.  Make sure to select the VSC to SnapCenter migration option.
+
You can only migrate metadata for existing backups. For example, if you do not have existing backups, then you cannot migrate policies only.

== Supported migration paths

See the link:scpivs44_release_notes.html[SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere Release Notes^] for information on supported upgrade and migration paths.
