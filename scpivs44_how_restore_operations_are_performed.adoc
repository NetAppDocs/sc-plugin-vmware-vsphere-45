For VMFS environments, the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere uses clone and mount operations with Storage VMotion to perform restore operations. For NFS environments, the plug-in uses native ONTAP Single File SnapRestore (SFSR) to provide greater efficiency for most restore operations. The following table lists how restore operations are performed.

Guest file restore operations are performed using clone and mount operations (not Storage VMotion) in both NFS and VMFS environments.

[IMPORTANT]
During a restore operation, you might encounter the error `Host unresolved volumes is null` or `Exception while calling pre-restore on SCV….Error mounting cloned LUN as datastore…` This occurs when the SnapCenter VMware plug-in attempts to resignature the clone. Due to VMware restrictions, the SnapCenter VMware plug-in cannot control the automatic resignature value in advanced ESXi configurations.
